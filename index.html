            <p class="lead">The Multitudinuous Misdirection of Modern Machines, a short essay on valuing form over function</p>
            <p>For all customization options, there are exactly 4 LEDs, so on first look we expect there to be only 4 options each. This is not true. After some months living here, all three roommates realized there were hidden Temperature, Water Level options for the Washer. This is because when you cycle through the options, there is a 5th option where the LED is off, which some were initially confused by and others simply didn't notice for a while.
            </p> 
            <p>This 5th option is marked smaller and somewhat sideways of the initial customization options list with an open circle (which is likely supposed to indicate off). However, it's not part of the list, which makes it not seem like an option. Furthermore, it's not clear that it's supposed to occur on an off LED option. Two roommates felt almost antagonized by this, asking "why would they even do this?", or claiming it "deceivingly makes it seem very new. It doesn't make sense like our simple, old dryer."
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, none of the roommates realized there was actually a 6th "hidden option" marked by an asterisk and small text and placed completely below the whole list AND button! If you held the button for 3 seconds, which no one ever did in their normal use of the machines, you would trigger this extra option. If you held both buttons down for three secconds, marked by an "-*Child Lock-" between the two buttons with lines connecting it to each button, then you could engage the child lock. However, while Samsung deemed the open circle sufficient for describing an LED off state, they understood that this asterisk did nothing to indicate "hold for 3 seconds". Thus, at the very top of the selection area completely separate from the buttons or options lists, there is the "*(hold for 3 sec)". Everyone was astounded that there were these extra options and that they were indicated in this way. Again, the sentiment that Samsung was trying to look sleek and new and that they were sacrificing readability and ease of use of traditional washers/dryers. Especially after being interviewed, my roommates strongly felt that our old washers and dryers were designed much better and more honestly, as they list all of the relevant options on a single knob, let you select exact times, and directly see time elapsed.</p>

            <p class="lead text-center">Working Watson works a demanding job at the hospital. It consistenly gets her clothes dirty and in need of cleaning. She often needs to clean her scrubs quickly before her shift, so it is important that she can easily select a quick option and that she know how much total time it will take. The interface makes both of these difficult, especially the time aspect since it's impossible to to set a timer for a wash cycle or know how long it will take. Working Watson represents many people who work in uniforms. They uniquely have a small set of clothes to wash which they use everyday, or even multiple per day, and so they need a lot of cleaning done, and often in a time-sensitive. </p>

            <h2>Old Ophelia</h2>
            <img src="images/Old-Ophelia.png" alt="Old Ophelia Empathy Map" style="width: 40rem; height: 40rem">
            <p class="lead text-center">Old Ophelia is 76 years old, but still wants to be independent and do her laundry like she always has. However, her son just got her a new, fancy washer and dryer set, and she's adjusting to it. She wants to make her sound happy, so she works hard to look at all the options and try to use this instead of asking for a simple, old washer set. However, the choice overload and unclear UI prevent her from understanding all her options and feeling satisfied with her product. She also can't read the very small text scattered amongst the interface. She represents all the users, which honestly includes myself and my interviewees as Brown students, who are trying to fully understand and use the interface, but simply can't because it's so badly designed. She also represents many users who are adapting to the more modern interfaces from simpler, more pragmatic designs of the past, and user with limitations such as bad eyesight.</p>
